From now on, all non-technical articles might not be wrote in English. For technical ones, they&#8217;ll always be wrote in English. I know it&#8217;s been a while that this blog is not updated. Today I decided to continue writing my life and experience down on this site. The original incentive for building this blog is job hunting, but soon I found this made writing boring. The blog should have more funny stuff.

以后非技术类文章会用中文来写，这个博客本不该这么无趣。原本写技术博客来帮助求职的想法太过愚蠢了，除了导致对编程的热情日渐流失，并没有给我留下什么。喜欢编程，这才是来CMU学CS的原因。
